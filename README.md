# Quantum Probability Density Visualization

This Jupyter Notebook code allows you to visualize the probability density of a complex quantum wavefunction using the `matplotlib` library. The script creates a 3D surface plot to depict the quantum probability density distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```python
!pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Run the following cell to define the necessary functions.

2. Create a new cell and run the code. You will be prompted to enter the range and number of points for the x-axis, as well as parameters for the complex wavefunction.

3. The 3D plot of the complex quantum probability density will be displayed directly below the code cell.

## How it works

The code uses the provided `complex_wavefunction` function to calculate a complex wavefunction as a superposition of two Gaussian wavefunctions along the x and y directions. It then generates the x and y values, calculates the wavefunction, and computes the probability density. The `quantum_probability_density_3d` function creates a 3D plot using `matplotlib`.

## Example

Here's an example of how to run the code:

1. Enter the range and points for the x and y axes.
2. Enter the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian wavefunction for both x and y directions.

The script will display a 3D plot showing the complex quantum probability density distribution resulting from the superposition of the Gaussian wavefunctions.
