# Quantum Probability Density Visualization

This Python script allows you to visualize the probability density of a quantum wavefunction using matplotlib. The wavefunction used in this script is assumed to be a simple Gaussian wavefunction for visualization purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `quantum_probability_density.py` file.

2. Run the script from the terminal or command prompt:


3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the range and points for the x-axis and parameters for the Gaussian wavefunction.

4. The script will plot the quantum probability density and display it using `matplotlib`.

## How it works

The script takes user inputs for the range and number of points on the x-axis and parameters for the Gaussian wavefunction, such as mean and standard deviation. It then generates x values and calculates the corresponding wavefunction using the Gaussian formula. The wavefunction is then normalized, and the probability density is computed and visualized using matplotlib.

## Example

Here's an example of running the script:

- Enter the range and points for x
- Enter the minimum value of x: -5
- Enter the maximum value of x: 5
- Enter the number of points: 1000

- Enter parameters for the Gaussian wavefunction:
- Enter the mean of the Gaussian wavefunction: 0
- Enter the standard deviation of the Gaussian wavefunction: 1


The script will display a plot showing the probability density of the Gaussian wavefunction centered around 0.
